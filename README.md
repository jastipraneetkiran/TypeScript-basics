# TypeScript-basics
Contains basic type Script theory

## **TypeScript**
```TypeScript is a superset to JavaScript, which means, that it compiles into pure JavaScript in the end.```
>First, it provides `strong typing` (that’s where the name comes from).
This means that we can(and should) assign types to our variables and class members. These types won’t compile to
JavaScript (as JS does not know types) but we will get compilation errors if we assign wrong types or make any 
other type-related errors.
